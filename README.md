# Quality Analysis for Machine Learning models

The three quality pillars are:

- **Functionality:** groups analyses that evaluate how ”well“ an AI module performs a
given task (i.e. assessing the suitability of an AI module for an application domain).


- **Comprehensibility:** groups analyses that try to open the blackbox and enable
stakeholders (model producers, users, or regulators) to interpret decisions and the
decision-making process. 


- **Robustness:** groups analyses that assess how the ML component responds to small
changes in the input.
